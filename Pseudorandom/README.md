- Some basic concepts for pseudorandom number generation via Linear Congruential Generators (LCG).

- An important measure of the statistical independence of the sequence of numbers generated by LCG is the spectral test, which can be formulated as a Shortest Vector Problem on Lattices (SVP). We present a code implementing the LLL algorithm to give an upper bound on the length of the shortest vector of a given lattice.
