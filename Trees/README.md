Some basic implementations  of the tree-like models for option pricing (theory can be found in Main: Discrete financial markets file):
- Binomial method for pricing European options (CRR model).
- Binomial method for pricing American options.
- Trinomial method (non-uniqueness of risk-neutral measure-> calibration).
