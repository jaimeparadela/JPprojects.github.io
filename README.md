DESCRIPTION: 
We present some simple projects about the mathematics of financial markets (in particular about option pricing). There are two types of files:

  Theory files in which relevant theoretical concepts are sketched (this may include background in numerical analysis, stochastic processes or finance).
  Code files in which we implement a particular numerical technique (in Mathematica or Python).



FILES (organized in folders): 

   Main: Two main theory files Main Discrete and Main Continuous which contain some basic concepts related to discrete and continuous market models.
    
  Discretization SDEs: A theory file introducing the Euler discretization of (certain) SDEs and the Euler-Maruyama Theorem on the convergence of this discretization. We also include some code files in which we implement this technique.
